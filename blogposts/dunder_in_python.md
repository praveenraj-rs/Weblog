Dunder (double underscore) methods, also known as "magic methods" or "special methods," provide Python objects with their functionality by overriding built-in behavior. Hereâ€™s a list of the most commonly used dunder methods in Python 3, categorized for easier understanding:

---

### **Initialization and Representation**

1. **`__init__(self, ...)`**  
   Called when initializing a new object.

   ```python
   def __init__(self, name):
       self.name = name
   ```

2. **`__repr__(self)`**  
   Returns a developer-friendly string representation of the object, primarily for debugging.

   ```python
   def __repr__(self):
       return f"ClassName({self.name!r})"
   ```

3. **`__str__(self)`**  
   Returns a user-friendly string representation of the object.

   ```python
   def __str__(self):
       return f"Object named {self.name}"
   ```

4. **`__del__(self)`**  
   Called when an object is about to be destroyed (cleanup actions).

---

### **Comparison and Ordering**

5. **`__eq__(self, other)`**  
   Defines behavior for equality (`==`).

6. **`__ne__(self, other)`**  
   Defines behavior for inequality (`!=`).

7. **`__lt__(self, other)`**  
   Defines behavior for less than (`<`).

8. **`__le__(self, other)`**  
   Defines behavior for less than or equal (`<=`).

9. **`__gt__(self, other)`**  
   Defines behavior for greater than (`>`).

10. **`__ge__(self, other)`**  
    Defines behavior for greater than or equal (`>=`).

---

### **Arithmetic Operations**

11. **`__add__(self, other)`**  
    Defines behavior for addition (`+`).

12. **`__sub__(self, other)`**  
    Defines behavior for subtraction (`-`).

13. **`__mul__(self, other)`**  
    Defines behavior for multiplication (`*`).

14. **`__truediv__(self, other)`**  
    Defines behavior for division (`/`).

15. **`__floordiv__(self, other)`**  
    Defines behavior for floor division (`//`).

16. **`__mod__(self, other)`**  
    Defines behavior for modulo (`%`).

17. **`__pow__(self, other)`**  
    Defines behavior for exponentiation (`**`).

---

### **Container and Length**

18. **`__len__(self)`**  
    Returns the length of an object (e.g., in `len(obj)`).

19. **`__getitem__(self, key)`**  
    Defines behavior for indexing (e.g., `obj[key]`).

20. **`__setitem__(self, key, value)`**  
    Defines behavior for assigning to an index (e.g., `obj[key] = value`).

21. **`__delitem__(self, key)`**  
    Defines behavior for deleting an index (e.g., `del obj[key]`).

22. **`__iter__(self)`**  
    Returns an iterator for the object.

23. **`__next__(self)`**  
    Returns the next item in an iterator.

---

### **Context Management**

24. **`__enter__(self)`**  
    Called when entering a context using the `with` statement.

25. **`__exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback)`**  
    Called when exiting a context.

---

### **Callable and Attributes**

26. **`__call__(self, ...)`**  
    Makes an object callable like a function.

27. **`__getattr__(self, name)`**  
    Defines behavior when an attribute is accessed that doesn't exist.

28. **`__setattr__(self, name, value)`**  
    Defines behavior for assigning to an attribute.

29. **`__delattr__(self, name)`**  
    Defines behavior for deleting an attribute.

30. **`__dir__(self)`**  
    Defines the behavior of the `dir()` function for the object.

---

### **Other Common Methods**

31. **`__hash__(self)`**  
    Defines behavior for hashing an object, used in sets or as dictionary keys.

32. **`__bool__(self)`**  
    Defines behavior for truth-value testing (e.g., in `if obj:`).

33. **`__contains__(self, item)`**  
    Defines behavior for the `in` keyword.

34. **`__index__(self)`**  
    Called when an object needs to be treated as an integer index.

These dunder methods make Python objects more intuitive and interoperable with built-in functionality. Overriding them carefully can help you design powerful, custom objects.
